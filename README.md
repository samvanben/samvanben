Hi! My name is Sam (he/him). 

I come from a graphic design and video editing background. I'm very excited to enter the world of software development!
Some fun facts about me are that I love playing video games, making music, and I know way too many facts about Sonic the Hedgehog.
If you ever need to reach me, the best way is through my email (samvanben@gmail.com).

Thanks for reading!
